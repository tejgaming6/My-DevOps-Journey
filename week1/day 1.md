# Day 1

what is DevOps

In my own words, DevOps is a culture/process that helps speed up the delivery of applications to production while maintaining quality, monitoring, testing, and automation

why devops?

in earlier days, before 10 years there was no devops, and we used to have sys admin,server admin and BRE

what use to happen that, developers write code, sys admin, make server, server admin, make application server and setup things, BRE deploys it, then testing stuff happens, the process use to take more time, since it was manually done, so which increase time, like testing, pre production and then production, Devops came into picture, where Devops Engineer automate all possible work, then look after it, while maintaining quality & ensuring proper testing is done, which saves a lot of time, from project go to production ( from build to client )
