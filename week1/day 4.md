# Day 4

VM part 2

it was fun knowing, different ways to make ec2, through api, anyone can save time, make services go life easily, but the person should share info in valid format that Aws can understand it, the persons is authenticated and authorized to do the actions or else it will get rejected 

AWS CLI 
AWS CFT
AWS CDK
Terraform and other ways you can spin up services 

if Terraform is used that means, it's hybrid, the org, is using services from 2 or cloud providers ( example Aws, Gcp, Azure )

Tip: Devops Engineer always should look after what is best for the Organization and make changes according to it

also had fun spinning up Ec2 using UI/Ux as of now!
