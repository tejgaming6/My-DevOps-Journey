Shell Scripting

In Linux, we use the shell to execute commands, Here are some commonly used commands that revised again 

ls – list directory contents

pwd – show the current location (present working directory)

cd – change directory

cd .. – go back one directory

cd ../.. – go back two directories

cd name/name – move directly into the specified second level directory

ls -ltr – list all items with detailed permissions, directories, and files

Permissions (e.g., 644) can be modified with chmod

touch – create a new file

free -mg – display memory usage in MB and GB

nproc – check the number of CPUs

df -h – check available disk space

top – view CPU, disk space, and RAM usage in real time
