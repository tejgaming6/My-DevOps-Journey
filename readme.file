## Overview

I’m Tej, and I’m transitioning into DevOps with a strong background in Web3 and community management. This journey is focused on building a solid foundation in cloud infrastructure, automation, and deployment practices, aiming for hands-on knowledge that prepares me for a DevOps role.

## Week 1: Linux Basics and Git

**Focus**: Understanding Linux commands, navigating the file system, and Git basics.

Daily Progress:
- Day 1: Practiced basic Linux commands (ls, cd, mkdir, rm).
- Day 2: Explored Git basics, creating and managing repositories.
- Day 3: Started with shell scripting, wrote a basic “Hello World” script.

Challenges: Learning to remember Linux commands was a bit challenging, but daily practice is helping!
